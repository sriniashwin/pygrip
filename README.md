This repository contains a bunch of python files created to assist with simple tasks

Thanks to sources such as stackoverflow, Coursera and other forums that have helped me find answers to coding questions I faced in coming up with these files.

A short note about each script follows:

fxextract - Fetches FX rates from ECB based on currencies and date provided by user. The rates are written into a text file.

Networkcheck - Checks internet connectivity by pinging google.com at periodic intervals. Writes result to a text file for reference.
